# Rice Grain Counting using OpenCV

This project is an **exploratory computer vision application** where I leveraged **OpenCV** to detect and count rice grains from images with high accuracy. The challenge was not just in detecting individual grains but also in handling **complex real-world cases** such as **overlapping or joined grains** that often lead to miscounts.  

Through **iterative experimentation** and **refined image preprocessing techniques**, I was able to build a pipeline that significantly improves grain detection accuracy.

## üîç Project Overview

- Implemented a **computer vision pipeline** using **OpenCV** in a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Tackled the problem of **accurately counting rice grains** in images, which involved challenges like:
  - Handling **joined/overlapping grains**.  
  - Eliminating background noise and unwanted reflections.  
- Designed and tested multiple approaches before refining the method for **robust detection and counting**.  

This project demonstrates skills in **image preprocessing, contour analysis, morphological operations, and object segmentation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Preprocessing** ‚Äì Applied grayscale conversion, thresholding, and filtering to clean the background.  
2. **Segmentation** ‚Äì Used contour detection and morphological operations to isolate grains.  
3. **Dealing with Joined Grains** ‚Äì Experimented with distance transforms, watershed segmentation, and custom logic to **separate touching grains**.  
4. **Counting & Validation** ‚Äì Counted grains and validated results visually with bounding boxes/contours.  
5. **Iterative Refinement** ‚Äì Fine-tuned parameters to improve **accuracy and consistency**.
