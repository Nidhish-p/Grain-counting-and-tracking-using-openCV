# Rice Grain Counting using OpenCV

This project is an **exploratory computer vision application** where I leveraged **OpenCV** to detect and count rice grains from images with high accuracy. The challenge was not just in detecting individual grains but also in handling **complex real-world cases** such as **overlapping or joined grains** that often lead to miscounts.  

Through **iterative experimentation** and **refined image preprocessing techniques**, I was able to build a pipeline that significantly improves grain detection accuracy.

## üîç Project Overview

- Implemented a **computer vision pipeline** using **OpenCV** in a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Tackled the problem of **accurately counting rice grains** in images, which involved challenges like:
  - Handling **joined/overlapping grains**.  
  - Eliminating background noise and unwanted reflections.  
- Designed and tested multiple approaches before refining the method for **robust detection and counting**.  

This project demonstrates skills in **image preprocessing, contour analysis, morphological operations, and object segmentation**.

## üî¨ Approach

The workflow followed for this project:

1. **Preprocessing & Background Removal**
   - Resized the input image for efficiency.
   - Converted to **HSV color space** and applied a mask to remove the blue background, isolating only the rice grains.

2. **Image Enhancement**
   - Converted to grayscale.
   - Applied **Gaussian Blur** to smooth noise.
   - Used **Otsu‚Äôs Thresholding** to separate grains from the background.

3. **Contour Detection & Classification**
   - Extracted contours representing grains.
   - Classified them into:
     - **Isolated grains** (small, well-defined contours).
     - **Touching grains** (larger contours that likely represent multiple grains).

4. **Grain Estimation**
   - Calculated the **average area** of isolated grains.
   - Estimated the number of grains in touching clusters by dividing contour area by average isolated grain area.

5. **Visualization**
   - **Yellow contours** = isolated grains.
   - **Green contours** = touching grain clusters.

This pipeline ensures robust grain counting, even when grains overlap or stick together.
